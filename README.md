# Break-Reminder-For-Win11 🚀
**A simple batch script to remind you to take a break from your system** 🛠️

---

In this script, users are reminded to take a break from their system. The system is then hibernated, saving resources and electricity consumption, while keeping current ongoing tasks running and safe. 🌱💻

## What is Hibernation? 🌙
When a system is hibernated, it saves the current state of the computer to the hard drive and then powers down completely. Below is a detailed explanation of hibernation and its comparison with shutdown and sleep mode:

### Hibernation 🛌
When a system is hibernated, it saves the current state (open applications, documents, etc.) to the hard drive and then powers down completely. This means it uses no power while off but allows you to resume exactly where you left off when you power it back on. Hibernation is ideal for long periods of inactivity, especially when you can't afford to lose your work due to power loss.

### Shutdown 📴
In contrast, shutting down a system closes all applications and processes without saving the current state, and then powers off completely. When you turn the system back on, it goes through the full boot process, starting fresh. This takes the longest time to resume compared to hibernation and sleep mode, and is suitable when you want to fully reset the system or don't need to preserve your session.

### Sleep Mode 🌜
Sleep mode, on the other hand, keeps the current state in the RAM while putting the system into a low-power state. This allows for a very fast wake-up time, as the system doesn't need to reload the session from the hard drive. However, it does use a small amount of power to maintain the RAM contents. Sleep mode is perfect for short breaks, enabling you to quickly resume your work with minimal delay.

## How to Use? 📋
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/TheBrightSoul/Break-Reminder-For-Win11/releases) and download the latest version.
2. Run the `script.bat` file. It will prompt you to take a break. Click **Yes** for a break or **No** if you wish to continue working.

## How to Use it Efficiently? ⏰
You can use Windows Task Scheduler to run this script every hour or so to ensure regular breaks. Here's how:
1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Create a new basic task.
3. Follow the prompts to schedule the script to run at your desired interval.
